And now, the final of Josephine's men rode with her in search of a solution whilst her poor father lay on the capital city, wrestling with fools and beaurecrats of the impending threat.

But Josee found herself untrained, her men slaughtered by forces of fade, and in her last moment, a Lord of Shade took her Gentle Light, causing her to become a Faded One.
