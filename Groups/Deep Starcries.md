Is a religious order of Knights who wield a unique magick called **Starry Water Magick**. They are nomad in nature and thus has no headquarters.

They trace their ancestry to [[Starlight Lyssandra]] and her son, [[Leonidas the Deepwatcher]].

Their goal is to collect all pieces of the 
oakenhearth and use it to channel the power of the stars, eventually ending the reliance on the [[Oakenhearth]].

But this plan hinges on the fact that the stars would not being the influence of the [[Outer God]]s.
