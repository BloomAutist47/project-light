Are humble monks living in [[Mt. Kalingrad]]. They study Philosophy and Magick within their monastery and welcomes anyone that wishes to learn.

None of them practices powerful magick as they believe that excess is what gives life its suffering.

They possess secrets and knowledges predating even the [[Oakenhearth]]. 

In spite of the absence of Light, the Monks living in Mt. Kalingrad remained unwithered.
