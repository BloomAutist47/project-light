A mysterious order wielding the powerful [[Golden Flame]].

Their main goal is to cleanse the world from its withering and entirely erase the [[Oakenhearth]]. They think that mankind's dependency on the [[Oakenhearth]] makes us vulnerable and weak, thus they opted to replace it with a [[Golden Flame]] within each and every human. A Fire which will stop mankind from withering. A power which lets them rely entirely on their own.

The founder of the order, [[Fiamma of the Golden Flame]], was once a disciple of the [[Monks of Kalingrad]]. Living in the temple and learning Philosopy and Magick, she had come to her conclusion that this is a rotting world, and that it must be cleansed in [[Golden Flame]].
