Also known as the Keeper of Knowledge, Mother of Ice Magick, Luciana keeps the [[First Flame]] in her Castle, the  [[Moon Castle]].

Luciana is a 24 feet  tall, beautiful, white-gray haired woman with wearing a simple white dress. She carries in her hands an egg which she carress. Presumably, it contains the body of her dead husband which she is trying to "Birth".

The [[Acturian Knights]] are her most loyal warriors serving under her.

When Josee stole a piece of the [[First Flame]], she sent her knights to hunt her and retrieve it back.

Luciana was originally not a god, but the mortal wife of her god husband. But when he waged war and he and his men were killed by the [[Empyrean]], she became widowed and had to bear tge weight of her husband's responsibility all by herself.

Eventually, she choose to harness the piwer of tge [[First Flame]], an act she despised to do as it had burned her sister back  then. Now she is left to lament, caring for subjects she did not care and upholding duties she wasn't supposed to carry, for her husband has long departed this world.

She now periodically wakes up and searches the [[First Flame]] for the knowledge to ressurect a fallen god, in hopes of finally meeting her beloved once more and ending the miseries of her duties.

When the Betrayal happened, Luciana was one of the few who chosen to commune with the [[Willowhearth]] and take an [[Oaken Light]]. But unlike other [[Faded Lord]], Luciana was able to isolate the effects of taking power from the [[Willowhearth]] and thus studied the [[Oaken Light]] and was able to freely use its powers.
