There is, but one knight who remained loyal to her. [[Flabious, Loyal Knight]], was a beggar boy that Lorean picked up as a trend back in the day amongst noble ladies, inspired by a book. Though he wasn't picked for kind reasons, [[Flabious, Loyal Knight]] remained grateful and, even though he knew the ending, he chose to remain loyal to [[Lorean, Lord of Face]] until the end.
