Is a kingdom populated by tall, and thin men known for their great craftsmanship.

Dueb to the fragility of their body, they rarely fight personally, thus they invented automatons as weapons of war and servitude. This, thus created prosperity within the kingdom of Bolenwyn.

When the Light faded, most of Bolenwyn's population succumbed to the abscenss of light. Thus the capital city, [[Oleparia]], became a ghost city, inhabited only by automatons who still keep their duties long after their masters has gone hollow.
