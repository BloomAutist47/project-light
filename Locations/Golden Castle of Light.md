The Castle by which the [[Oakenhearth]] is stored.

In the current present dady, the Golden Castle has lost its luster and is now nothing but a desolate and abandoned castle, populated by small criters and vile beasts.

Within its hidden chambers lies [[Yagranoth the Unsundering]], sleeping besides his wife [[Lyra the Radiant]].
