Oaken Lights are pieces of Light originally contained within the  [[Oakenhearth]], the vessel which radiates this Light to protect the [[Mundane Lands]].

But the [[Willowhearth]] continuously steal the Oaken Light from the [[Oakenhearth]] and grants it to those that commune with it, becoming [[Faded Lord|Faded Lords]].

All faded Lords carry a piece of the Oaken Light.
