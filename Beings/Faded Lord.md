Are desperate beings who, in search for power, linked their soul to the [[Willowhearth]], and were granted pieces of Light that the[[Willowhearth]] stole from the [[Oakenhearth]]. But doing so turned them cold, unfeeling beings who are nothing but a shadow of their former selves.

They now sustain themselves by taking the [[Gentle Light]] of others, in a futile act to become their former selves.

[[Faded Lord]] also are incapable of creating anything of simple nature. Everything they do is overcomolicated and obscure with foreign language that they are indicernible.

Killing a Faded Lord will drop their stolen Light. A necessary component in restoring the [[Oakenhearth]].
