Are human beings who lost their [[Gentle Light]]. Contrary to what one would expect, the Faded Ones still have Light within them, albeit a tiny speck of it. This speck, also known as a [[Faded Light]] will keep falling in intensity whenever a faded one dies until their inevitable madness.

The reason why a faded one cannot die is because Light is what gives them their material body. Without the Light, they became akin to ghosts and imaginations and thus whenver they die, their misformed body recreates itself.

They cannot go wither for there is no light to take from them, as their light has been stolen.
