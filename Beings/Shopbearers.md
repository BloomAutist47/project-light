Are strange and mysterious beings who exists throughout the Mundane Lands, peddling their wares. They appear to be foreign entities who bear not the [[Gentle Light]] but a completely alien Light, characterized by its purple hue.

They appear to be killable, as shown by other characters. But those who tried to steal tjeir wares always find it disappearing in faded light.

# Behaviours
Despite any aggressions shown towards Shopbearers, they display no signs of hostility and should they be killed, they will be found later, alive and more than willing to sell wares again even to those that had killed them. This mysterious immortality had scared even the mightiest beings in the land.

Sympathy or any form of emotions does not drive the Shopbearers, only their desire to peddle their wares.

They often comments and on whatever you buy, and some of them are even talkative, although any form of inquiry to their origin results in cold silence.

# Goal
As it stand, the shopbearer's goal seems to be the singleminded selling of wares to heroes or would be legends, or to any being that has a purpose. They seem to derive pleasure from being able to sell to them, even at a loss.

As for why they do this, it remains unknown. Some speculates that they bear the mark of an [[Outer God]] who precide over merchantiles.


# History
The shopbearers first appeared in the Mundane Lands after the [[Stabbing of the Hearth]], splinterring it into pieces.
