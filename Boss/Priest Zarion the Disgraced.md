Is a [[Withered]] who used to be the priest of the humble town of [[Greenfield]]. Though he preaches words of salvation, Priest Zarion would indulge in sexual activities with the young underage girls of the village behind closed doors.

When the Light Faded, the villagers all began withering and they turned to him for salvation. Priest Zarion, not knowing what to do, hid behind the walls of the Chapel for weeks.

On one of the nights where Zarion went to his basement, one of the girls he assaulted tried to kill him. He managed to kill the young girl, but not before having his member cut off. In pain, he came out of the chapel and saw the withered men and women who have now completely lost their mind. He looked at his hands who no longer looked human.

He turned to his god and begged for mercy that he shouldn't have been who he were and that he should have saved the people until eventually, he went fully withered and malformed into a monstrosity.
