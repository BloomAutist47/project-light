# Plot
The story began, with a betrayal.

The world emerged from a conflicted past. The shatterring of the Oakenhearth and its missing piece made the world imbalanced  And from this chaos, arose the Order of Kings, who split the five remaining pieces of the Oakenhearth and created domes of light which protected their lands.

[[Selenia, Master of Twilight]] betrayed the [[Order of Kings]], stealing two fragments of the Oakenhearth.

And in this betrayal, she killed her twin sister, **Sunderia, Morningstar** in order to take her Light. For what reason she betrayed us, nobody knows.

But in the wake of Sunderia's death, her lover, [[Galleon the Moonhealer]], in a desperate bid, casted all known healing spells upon Sunderia's body. So much potent healing spells were casted that the barren lands began growing life and trees. 

But Sunderia would not wake, for her body remained fine, but the soul has long fled. And her Gentle Light, cruelly taken away.

And so it was, that a corpse remained unrotting, and in this potent sea of healing birthed a poison which caused unfettered growth, perverting everything within the lands. From the center of this poison, grows a mishapen tree.

Of what had occured to Galleon the Moonhealer, nobody knew. 

One of the Kings, the mightiest of them all, [[Orbain the Unthetered Light]], fought against Selenia, Twilight master. The battle shook the lands and caused the laws of the earth to break. In their battle, Selenia blotted the Skies with her terrible spell. With the skies gone, the Light of the Oakenhearths could not travel and thus Orbain's power weakened, unable to channel Unthetered Light. But no winner would come from this battle, for Selenia left with her arms severed, and Orbain weakened.

As Orbain rose from the wake of the battle, the gravity of the lands they fought were unshakled, the laws of the earth in disarray.

Orbain had taken one piece of the Oakenhearth that Selenia stole. Orbain was supposed to return the Oakenhearth to its respective king, but with the Sky Blotted, Orbain decided to keep the two pieces of the Oakenhearth he posses and protect his own Kingdom. There, he cast a spell to keep his people from knowing of what had occured.

For Orbain knew that the Light of the Oakenhearth is fading, and that it is only a matter of time before it completely fade.

In a desperate attempt, she brought the last of her men to search for Light based on scrumptuous rumours. But what had waited her was horror.
