In an age long far gone, the Light that protects the Mundane Lands has gone dark. It's pieces in shatters, why and how, no one knows. As the world descends to chaos, a mighty King cleaved a piece, refusing to do his duty, he sacrificed the many in the name of his people. And so, the world was left asunder.

But beyond the fogs, lies a fallen. A daughter of man, forgotten, unbegotten, a Faded One - beings who has lost their Gentle Light.

She rose from dull sand and echoed a final roar. Living, but yet fading. Determined, she set out on a quest to cure her people of the rot that withers them... or fade away herself.

Josephine Kalingrad is the daughter of a poor and obscure baron from the country border. But everything changes when the Light that protects the borders began fading, leaving their peaceful teritory in taters, bleak , and forsaken.

And now, the final of Josephine's men rode with her in search of a solution whilst her poor father lay on the capital city, wrestling with fools and beaurecrats of the impending threat.

But Josee found herself untrained, her men slaughtered by forces of fade, and in her last moment, a Lord of Shade took her Gentle Light, causing her to become a Faded One.
