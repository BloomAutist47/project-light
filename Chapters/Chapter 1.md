"Oh, [[Faded One]]... arise from the fog"

As the hums of an old one echoed through the gloom of the humid mist, a body twitches.

And from the shadow ashes, rose a faded being. One whose [[Gentle Light]] has been stolen.

Her body seemed human, but upon close inspection, it reveals a tiny transluscence.

The scarlet hair dripped through her back, as it embraced the tattered red noble dress that has now... grown dull.

And her neck, revealed strange chitin-like scales.

"Thou cameth through these lands, in search for cure, does one not?", the sweet, melancholic and young voice of an old one echoed.

She raised her head and her tired red eyes stared into the white light, suddenly begotten from the depths of the fog.

"Be that as it may, I shall guide thee. Follow the light, oh [[Faded One]]"

She began walking, feeling the weakness from her body.

As the Light quivered, she felt its warm embrace fade away, like a quick and simple lullaby.

Her eyes opened, and a bleak world of gloom unveiled itself. 

Down into the dark meadows laid a graveyard of unending bones and churns. Withered trees, unchecked thorn bushes, and ravens of omen inhabited the lands.

A knowledge paid with a cost she could not live with.

But some things had to be done, Josephine thought as she curled her eyes into a downward stare.

She sighed, before looking into the horizon. Within this foggy, bleak world, laid a single tower with a golden, dull Light.

She looked at her palm. Transluscent and fading, and yet, she felt an instinct within her to approach that very Light.

And so, Josephine began her wander. She took a blade stabbed to the ground, rusted and dented, she wielded it with one hand.

As the scenery changes with her every step down into the road, the corpses that laid before her grew in number, as did the broken caravans and pack horses filled with rotting items.

Suddenly, behind the withered trees, a shadow moved.

Josephine observed. It was a person, or used to be, whose body is withered, whose soul is in limbo, and whose entire being is embraced by a dark mirage.

Shadowed.

Josee remembered. The end of the curse, when the fi al Light that guides the mind completely... faded.
