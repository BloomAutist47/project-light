Chapter 1 — Josee

"… Well, shit," a deep, feminine voice cussed loudly.

The tick-tock swinging of the hanging pendulum filled the humble room. A cross-sword was displayed on the aging reddish-brown walls, some old scenic paintings were spotted here and there, and the chandelier looked as if it was inherited from hundreds of years ago.

In the old furniture, a woman sat on the sofa seat before the windows. She wore a modest green dress, yet she showed a certain dignified sophistication befitting that of a noble. Seated there with her legs crossed, the woman sighed while holding a cheap teacup and a saucer in both her hands.

She placed the teacup on the saucer before looking forward with stern, cold eyes.

"… Why is this happening to me?" She glanced to her left to see an old mirror filled with cracks.

Long, dark brown hair with bangs on her forehead, a slightly pretty face, and a pair of cold, almost emotionless, brown eyes.

"… Josephine Kalingrad," her voice became deeper, as her face grew darker.

The face she saw was familiar. Very familiar, yet quite strange, for it was not the face she used to own.

She sighed before touching her glabella with her right hand.

"… I've been here for three days… to think I reincarnated as Josee. A side character who was supposed to die… sigh…," Josee sighed again before standing up and walking near the window's edge.

A medieval seaport town appeared right in front of her eyes. Small fishing vessels filled the ports, and many people went about their everyday life. The scent of salt washed over the air, and as Josee smelled this, it somehow reminded her of a distant past.

"… Aquel… a poor, humble town ruled by my father… well, he's in the empire's capital city right now," Josee observed the people. They wore simple clothing made of tunic, hemp, or wool. The color of their clothes varied from blue to red, to green, and sometimes pink or brown. It was quite colorful, as if Josee was staring at a reenactment of a medieval era.

Except… this was real.

"… Baron Kalingrad. A poor baron who will soon be brought to ruin…," Josee lightly smiled.

"… If you think about it, this is the perfect identity for me… after all," Josee's eyes grew colder as a glint of madness shone within.

"… I'm going completely tangent from this novel's main story," she wickedly smiled.

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

A carriage bearing the simple crest of the Kalingrad family rode through the town square. A humble fish jumping from the water adorned the crest, as if desiring to fly through the skies. Josee sat in the carriage, but unlike before, she did not wear her dress.

She wore leather pants and a long-sleeved white tunic. Her dark brown hair was tied in a ponytail, and a simple orange earring adorned her ears. A pair of brown leather gloves fit her hands, and on her hips was a dagger.

"M-My lady?" A maid, no older than fifteen, sat before her. She was blonde-haired, with deep blue eyes and a rather cute face. But her body looked rather frail, smaller than what her age was supposed to be like.

Her eyes were glued on Josee, bearing a crease on her eyebrows.

As the carriage continued through town, the light of the morning sun permeated through the windows, creating a ray of shadow throughout Josee's cold face.

'… A cookie-cutter reverse harem love story between the peasant girl and the crown prince… Jesus, just shoot me in the head', Josee sighed.

'I truly had shit taste back when I was a teenager… but this particularly story poses a problem… '

'… In the end, the world gets destroyed and everyone dies', Josee lightly frowned.

'… It was a rather shit ending. But the author explained that it was a satire from the beginning… '

'… Well, we can't have that now, can we?'

"… Misha", Josee calmly spoke.

'… Then there's only one solution…'

"Y-Yes!", the young maid shivered.

'… I need power'

"… I need you to go buy these things for me", from her breastpocket, Josee took a piece of paper and handed it to Misha, "Take Schulga with you"

'… But for a girl like Josephine Kalingrad… she has no talent. A blank slate meant to die a dog's death'

Shakily taking it with both her arms, Misha read through the list, only for her eyes to grew wide.

"M-My l-l-lady?!", she light shrieked, as the list of items horrified her.

'… So what do we do?'

"… What was my order?", Josee asked.

"B-Buy these things!", Misha replied in fright.

"… Good. Now go". Josee signalled the carriage to stop at the merchant district, before letting Misha go.

Finally, left alone, Josee commanded the carriage to go forward.

Far into the edge of the town.

'… What do we do? It's simple really'

'… We steal talents'


◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


"… Go back and escort Misha back home"

"But My lady!", the carriage driver spoke in a hurried voice, "This is wilderness, I can't just leave you here!"

"… That's an order", but Josee remained adamant, commanding in a deep and authoritative voice.

"I… ughh… the baron is going to kill me", the carriage driver grit his teeth. After seeing the cold and stern eyes of his young lady, he gave up and turned around.

Left alone in the wilderness, Josee began walking with heavy steps. In her back, she carried a satchel with one shoulder.

Josee strode through the forest east of town, down into the uncharted wilderness. Her senses were sharped, and when something scurried nearby, she immediately hid behind trees or boulders.

Josee quietly hid inside an empty log, as a scaled beast roamed nearby. Her eyes remained cold, quiet. When the beast left, so did she, with the utmost silence she could muster.

Her trekking led her to pass by a crescent moon shaped lake. Josee stared into that lake before biting her lips. As she stood at its edge, she had an urge to quickly jump down, but she resisted and moved forth throughout her journey.

After three hours of trekking through the forest, she was already exhausted, sweating, and completely uncomfortable.

"… This shitty body that never exercised… tsk", but all's not in vain, for as she saw the structure before her face, Josee wickedly smiled.

A crack in the mountain wall, covered in moss and vines. It was such an inconspicuous thing that nobody would have entered it… except for someone crazy.

Josee then slowly crawled through the crevice. It was tight, and the walls were sharp. The crawling insects made her extremely uncomfortable, and as she squeezed further, she felt her lungs almost losing air. But Josee persevered, until she exits through the squeeze.

It was already dark inside, and Josee could barely see anything. Pulling a small lantern from her satchel, she activated the magic stone embedded in it, releasing an intense light. And at that moment, what revealed to her was an extremely large cavern of many sparkling stalactites formations and limestone dew. For a moment, Josee was struck frozen by the beauty of the white ivory world that appeared before her eyes.

Josee exhaled while smiling. An innocent smile formed in her face.

"… It's more beautiful than what the author wrote. I can't believe it", Josee smiled brightly. But after appreciating it, she immediately shook her head and her cold gaze returned.

Josee began her preparation. She took a rope, a metal pike and a hammer from her satchel. She tied the rope to a cavern column before tying it up on the metal pike. Furthermore, she then hammered it down on the ground.

She tightly tied the rope to her waist and chest. Then, another rope was taken from her satchel which she tied to another column. This time, she held the winded end of the rope in her hands.

From the satchel, she took a small bag and attached it to her waist. It was filled with a white, powdery chalk which she covered her hands with. Finally, Josee took out a potion of orange color before drinking it.

Strength flowed through Josee's veins. But with it came a little pain. Once the pain receded, she can feel her body brimming with energy.

Her tongue licked her lips, and an excited smile formed in her cold face.

"… Let's fucking go", Josee wickedly smiled. Greed shone through her eyes. She walked to the edge of the cavern cliff… and began climbing down.

The climb was difficult. Josee almost slipped in many times. She placed her foot in small rock protrusions, only for some of them to break.

As she descended, with the candle on her hips, Josee suddenly saw markings on the cave… Ancient Markings.

It was a depiction, carefully etch on the stones. It depicted a battle of a million soldiers. Of a warring era. In the depictions, Josee saw giant entities holding mighty weapons, spears, bolts of lighting and firestorms. The humans, or what they seem to be, were waging war against these titans.

Josee slowed her descent.

And as she slowly descended, the depictions grew… darker. The millions of soldiers became fewer in cluster, and more skulls were shown. When Josee took a closer look to the wall in front of her, she realized that it depicted not only humans, but of other races; of beings with long ears, with mighty horns, with strong greenish bodies, and those with scales and tails. It was an unusual sight, and yet they seemed united. In their many struggles, Josee witnessed how the farther she descended, the fewest of these people appeared.

Until when she almost reached the ground there was nothing but a sea of cold, dead bodies. Women children, men, the old, many were sacrificed, murdered, raped, mutilated, treated like cattle.

It was a horrifying sight, Josee thought, before finally landing on the ground. She turned around to look at the cave walls in the bottom.

And there, lied thirteen titans, standing over millions, maybe billions of dead bodies.

Josee deeply inhaled, before exhaling.

'*… I knew I will see these… but I just never thought*', she gripped her fist, and her eyebrows furrowed.

'*… I would be affected by it. It's like I felt the emotions of all those that came before me*', Josee sighed, before moving forward.

She untied the ropes in her body before she began stepping through the rough cavern floor. As she proceeded with the magick lantern in her left hand, the path forward converged into a single, large hallway.

As she walked deeper, the floor changed into a white, dust filled marble. Deeper inside, columns made of iron polluted the giant hallway.

And finally, she saw her intended location.

A titanic gate. And in those doors, depicts a single being, carved very intricately into the ivory door.

A single being, clad in mighty dragon armor stood on top of every titan she saw. Wielding a blade of terrible power. The twilight sun appeared behind its back.

But as she witnessed this, Josee's eyes opened widely, shivering. Witnessing such a monumental work from the ancient days has truly struck her astonished. But it wasn't its impressive size, nor its might that shook her.

It was the fact that these depictions never existed… in the story she once read.

"… What?"

Cold sweat flowed through Josee's back.

She bit her lips.

*'… This story… it was never about the romance, wasn't it?'*

Her instinct… shouted at her. That once she opened these gates, something irrevocable will happen, something she should never do.

Josee gulped down.

She remembered the original story.

"… It was… a work of satire, a mockery of the genre. As the characters were all busy with their romantic life and bullshit, the world around them slowly started crumbling apart… ", Josee frowned. She forced herself to remember what little detail she could find in her mind.

And as she recalled these memories, something popped up. Horror filled her eyes.

"… *And a lone warrior struggled, fighting against the evil that descended. Alone and weak, he fought to the end, a one-man war to protect the world he loved*…", Josee grit her teeth.

It was a single line. The only line that mentioned the existence of a hero… and yet…

"… That damned story… the world was never about the reverse harem romance", Josee cruelly frowned.

"… It was just a minor story, a backdrop against a slowly crumbling world, behind the story of a single lone hero that failed to save their world… fuck!"

Josee remembered all the artefacts, all the mcguffin and magical items that were found throughout the story but were inevitably never used to their full potential.

"… If only the hero had those things, maybe he could've saved this world"

But the hero did not have any of those, for he fought even without any blessings.

He was a lone hero.

And now, Josee stood right in front of a gate, a gate that was supposed to lead to an easy treasure… but she was not a fool. She witnessed the depictions placed upon the walls before this. And now, she sees the carving of the ultimate hero that saved mankind during ancient times.

Josee knew… whatever was behind these walls… is a legacy of the ancient hero.

"… Fuck! Fuck!", She started pacing about here and there.

"… This shithole was depicted at the mid-part of the story where the magic male lead took an artefact to save the heroine. But fuck, if the door changed, the contents should have changed too!"

She sat on the ground, placing the lantern right in front of her.

Breathing in and out, Josee began thinking…

And thinking, and thinking… Hours passed, and after many a thousand deliberations and thoughts, Josee finally made a decision.

She opened both of her own eyes.

Placing her hands on the crystal orb, she released a tiny flow of mana before speaking the words that she was not supposed to utter.

"… Άνοιξε το μονοπάτι, έρχομαι εδώ με τη θέληση του υπάκουου ανθρώπου, θα κάνω ό, τι πρέπει να γίνει"

And the door shook. Dust began falling, and as the mechanisms activated for the first time in tens of thousands of years, a sudden, instantaneous golden light echoed through the line carved in the giant door, illuminating the whole underground hallway.

Josee gulped down, and the door slowly opened inward.

She stared forward and saw an extremely wide room, illuminated by golden lights running through a geometric shape on the floor. In the center lied but a single dark bracelet floating upon a golden pedestal. Josee frowned upon seeing it.

'… As expected… it changed. That was supposed to be a sword'

Josee observed the surroundings. For five minutes, she stood there, merely listening to the eerie silence. Pulling a small stone from her satchel, she threw it to the center. Nothing happened.

Clutching the dagger by her hip with her right hand, she slowly moved forward.

A single step. Second step. Third step. Slowly, she walked with fierce wary eyes until she reached the center.

The plain floating bracelet lay there. Josee slowly raised her left hand.

And then, she touched that dark bracelet.

A single touch.

Everything suddenly suddenly curved. Light bending instantaneously, reality itself seems to fall apart. Josee felt her body suddenly transported, travelling at the speed of light. Her body travelled to a thousand different realities, witnessing billions of geometric fractal formations and the destruction and creation of countless universes.

She could not think. She could not react. Her body was frozen in space as she could not comprehend the things happening to her. And as she travelled through countless fracturing realities, her body was suddenly pulled and brought back to her true reality.

She fell down to her knees. Sweating, pale, afraid. Her cold eyes shivered endless as she hurriedly breathed in and out.

Suddenly, she realized everything became dark. She turned around, and then she felt a statue right behind her. And then… it crumbled.

The clouds from her eyes, vanished, and what laid before her were dozens, nay, hundreds of statues, both men and women, reaching their hands towards the center of spacious room. Dust and cobweb filled their bodies, and as Josee stared at everything in horror, her eyes slowly widened in realization.

Those were not statues.

"… Ah… ahhh….", she stepped back. This was the same room as before, but somehow it drastically changed, as if the one from before was but a mere illusion.

As Josee took a step back, she eventually stopped, almost stumbling as something hit her back. Slowly turning around, she saw an object floating on the once golden pedestal. On that moss covered pedestal, an eerie dark sword lined with white color floated.

It gave off a rather dark energy, one which made Josee feel suffocated.

She gulped down, before reaching her hands forward. And when her hands touched the sword's handle, crimson lighting flashed, and a sudden force propelled her far away! Immediately slamming on the moss covered marble walls.

Spitting a mouthful of blood, Josee felt her consciousness fading.

**"Thou hast the strength of will to carry on"**, a deep, maddening voice, echoed through the room. Josee tried to regain her posture. With difficulty, she kept her eyes towards the sword.


**"Yet not the power to push forth. To break thy mortality"**, the voice… sighed in disappointment.

The silence… echoed through the room. The voice filled Josee's head. And as she grits her teeth, with eyes moving about everywhere and a palpitating heart, she heard an ultimatum.

**"Leave. Thou are much… unfurnished.  Return when thou hast the power to reshape thy destiny"**

And then the voice, spoke, as if it was begging her.

**"And perhaps… Thou shall finally be the one… to break this wretched cycle"**

Josee blinked her eyes… And she found herself beneath a starry night sky. Her breathing slowly calmed down. She turned to her left and right, only to realized that the coldness from her back was from the water beneath her.

She laid floating within the crescent moon lake she passed by before.

As she gazed coldly into the skies, she suddenly broke into a smile, then a chuckle, then finally, into hysterical laughter.

After a while, Josee calmed down, before staring in silence. She raised her right hand, as if reaching for the twin moons adorning the skies like pearls.

"… I suppose nothing comes for free. I overestimated myself… and bit more than I can chew". Josee lightly exhaled.

Josee closed her eyes, as she recalled the ending of the story. It was still vivid to her, as if she just read it yesterday. For that ending, was one of the most well-detailed narrative she's ever seen in her entire life.

And it was an utterly, fucked up ending… with all the characters becoming mere toys.

Josee opened her eyes again.

"… No", she whispered in silence, with an almost desperate yet arrogant tone, "I will not let such ending befall upon me"

"… Another chance to live, I will not die a dog's death again…", her face… slowly twisted into a ravenous fury. Contorting as she gnashed her teeth.

She closed her raised hand, tightly to the point her palms bled.

"… I will live… Even if that means butchering this entire world"
