"Harken O [[Faded One]]... arise from the fog"

As the haunting melodies of an old one echoed through the misty fog, a frail being stirred.

And from dull sand, there emerged a faded being. One whose [[Gentle Light]] hath been purloined.

Her form seemed human, but upon close scrutiny, it revealed a tiny transluscence.

The scarlet hair dripped through her back, as it embraced the tattered red noble garb that has now... grown dull.

And her neck, revealed strange chitin scales.

"Hast thou ventured across these lands in search of cure, has one not?" spoke the dulcet, melancholic voice of an old one.

She raised her head and her tired red eyes stared into the white light, suddenly begotten from the depths of the fog.

"Nevertheless, I shall guide thee. Pursue the light, O Faded One."

She began walking, feeling the weakness from her body.

"For thou art be faded. It is thy curse to seek Light"

"Or thou mayest fade... for that too, is a choice"

---

As the Light quivered, she sensed its tender embrace recede, akin to a fleeting and facile lullaby.

Her eyes opened, and a bleak world of gloom unveiled itself. 

Down into the dark meadows laid a graveyard of unending bones and churns. Dead trees, unbridled brambles, and ill-fated ravens populated the lands. And to the sky, she beheld a somber firmament of Light, everlastingly draped in twilight. A heaving sky, as though its ultimate breath of illumination could perish at any given instant.

She turned to observe her surrounding before realizing she had woken up... in front of a tombstone.

And behold, on the etches of the stone, overgrown with lichen and wriggling vermin, was her very own name.

Josephine Kalingrad.

It was indeed her name, and yet she could no longer be certain of such.  For her memories swirled in a labyrinthine maze of cognizance, beholding an array of knowledge she should not have.

A knowledge paid with a cost she could not live with.

But some things had to be done, ruminated Josephine, as she cast her eyes downward.

She heaved a sigh, before peering into the horizon. In this mist-shrouded, desolate realm stood a solitary tower, radiating a golden dull Light.

She gazed upon her palm, translucent and dwindling, yet an urge within impelled her to approach that very Light.

And thus, Josephine commenced her journey. She grasped a blade impaled in the earth, rusted and marred, brandishing it in one hand.

With each stride along the path, the corpses that strewn before her grew in number, as did the broken caravans and pack horses filled with rotting goods.

Suddenly, behind the withered trees, a shadow stirred.

Josephine observed. It was a person, or used to be, whose body is withered, whose soul is in limbo, and whose entire being is embraced by a dark mirage.

Withered.

Josephine remembered. The end of the curse, when the final Light that guides the mind completely... faded.

It strode forth, headed in her direction. And as it stumbled, its ghastly maw parted, bellowing in the most abhorrent fashion known to man.

It roared gibberish, but perhaps because she too, was faded, that she understood.

End me.

It begged.

And so, Josephine clutched her blade with both hands. The Withered lunged itself towards her like a mindless beast, writhing and staggering. Josephine evaded swiftly to her right.

And with great clumsiness, but with resolute determination, she gripped her sword and thrust it through the beast's neck.

Withered blood seeped through, and the beast fell.

Josephine coldly stared with her red eyes. The dust settled as the battle swiftly ends.

A fragile, insignificant speck of light arose. Josephine extended her arm forth, gently clusping the light within her hands. She looked at it with sorrowful eyes. But such emotion were quite fleeting.

And with weary breath, Josephine pressed onward, her steps refusing to falter.

As Josephine trod further down the road, she beheld many other Withered souls. Among them were soldiers, others merchants, and most were nothing but common peasants. Poor men who had all been struck by an ill fate not of their own making.

It was a sickness wrought by the absence of Light, mused Josephine.

She wielded her blade once more, and in the path surrounded by dead oak trees, Josephine battled against two withered soldiers.

The chain mails around their necks were rusted and fractured, their brigandine armor in shreds and stained brown and black from filth. Their skin, bone and shrivelled from the dark withering.

In their tattered armor, they bore the mark of the Rosen Blade.

Josephine remembered them.

They attacked her, hurling their cursed bodies... they screamed.

Release us... please...

And their sorrows, Josephine heard. She lightly cast her red eyes downwards.

With deft movements, Josephine dodged two steps back as one of the withered soldiers wildly swung their broken blade. Another launched itself towards her in a desperate lunge.

Reacting quickly, Josephine evaded to the right. Though unsteady, she regained her balance and with determination, raised her blade to strike.

But withered soldiers were not mere peasants. With a swift parry, they deflected her strike, sending Josephine tumbling to the ground.

She looked at the withered soldiers, knowing that they were once men like her. But now, they were just husks of their former selves, cursed and corrupted by absense of Light.

Josephine stepped forth, her tattered noble dress, wisking. The withered soldiers followed suit, their movements jerky and uncoordinated.

With a deep breath, Josephine charged towards them, her blade gleaming in the dim light. The withered soldiers swung their blades, but Josephine dodged with ease, her movements fluid but quite awkward.

She swung her blade, aiming for their necks, but the withered soldiers were quick to parry. Josephine grit her teeth under her breath, her frustration mounting.

But she did not give up. She swung again and again, each time with more force and determination. Finally, one of the withered soldiers stumbled, its defenses faltering. Josephine seized the opportunity and plunged her blade deep into its neck.

The other withered soldier screamed, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. 

She stood her ground, and once more, raised her blade horizontally with both hands. Her arms shook, and her hands, blisterred. But her will remained steadfast.

She stepped forward, and the last Withered Soldier lunged itself. Josephine breathed in and out... And in the spark moment, in that infinitesimaly split second, Josephine stabbed her blade.

A ringing sound echoed, and the lifeless body of the Withered went limp. Josephine pulled her sword from its head, its cursed soul finally released from its withered body.

And once more, an insignificant faded Light arose. Two of them.

Josephine stood there, breathing heavily, her blade still dripping with withered blood. 

She stared at them... and the memories of the past emerged. Back when the previous King lived, an army was sent towards the borders, to quell an invasion, and to save thy feeble peasants.

She remembered the arrogance of the King. But though he was high and mighty, he cared for the people, that though he was powerful, the weak never left his watchful eyes.

And these were his soldiers... forgotten... pitiful.

But memories were nothing but... memories...

She had to move forward. Out of this grave. Out of this cursed land, she had to reach the gloomy light on the horizon, fading and shivering.

She knew that her answers lies over there. And that she must reach it.

Josephine sighed. Once more, she feebly strode.

Time passed. Along the way, she had fought many Withered. Lost souls, each begging to end their misery.

And as the hours passed, her collection of faded light kept grewing in number, a reminder of the tragedy that had occured to these poor souls.

She climbed through walls, and sneaked through passages unearthed by the conflicts of the past.

Until eventually, Josephine arrived at a chapel. Much like all that lives here, it too, was withered. The glass windows were cracked, the wooden doors were broken, and tower bell is missing.

And so, Josephine stood in front of tge rotting chapel.

The creaking of the doors, the bellowing of a hollowed wind, and the murmuring of crows, all of 


She knew that there were more battles to come, more souls to be freed from their cursed existence. But for now, she had won this battle. And that was enough.
