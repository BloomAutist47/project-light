Are Magick Shards imbued with [[Light]], taken from pieces of the  [[Oakenhearth]]. As time passes, they grew dimmer until they completely fade away.

They require a relighting every time they fade.

The Light Shards were setup by [[Galleon the Moonhealer]], his followers, and some of those from the [[Order of Kings]] in an attempt to bridge a path of Light among the darkened land, ungraced by Light.

The Light Shard has a special attribute of allowing a [[Faded One]] to resurrect near it. All they need to do is touch the Light and their soul will remember it, allowing them to wake up near it.
