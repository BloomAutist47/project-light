is the flame which created the world.
It also contains all of the world's Knowledge, past and future.

Although it carries great knowledge, anyone that tries touching it are almost always burned, unable to carry the might of its flames.

Before the [[Oakenhearth]] came, there was only Fire.

Beings who had been able to harness its power were given great power, and were heralded as Gods.

When the [[Fragile being]] came and taught the [[Shadows]] and gave them [[Gentle Light]], the Gods became furious and slew the [[Fragile being]]. 

But his legacy lived on, his hear forming the [[Oakenhearth]] and giving Light into the world. Shortly after a thousand years, mankind still remember the atrocities commited by the [[Gods]], and thus the [[Empyrean]]s rised up and killed and dethroned them, vanishing them beyond the [[Fog]].

To this day, only a few gods remain alive, but are now nothing but husks of their former selves.
