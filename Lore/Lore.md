Theme:
- Degradation in the refusal to uphold morality and what Ought to be done

Once there was no [[Light]], only darkness. During this time, there were only monsters and chaos gods who brought ruins upon the pitiful shadows.

It was during this time that the Eternity Well, mysterious and powerful, spewed the Spark of Light which granted immense power upon those who picked it. Powerful chaos gods divided it among themselves and thus gained individuality. One of them, however, was meek and fragile. He did not find Light, but he found a flame that gives warmth. And with it, he gave heat to the cold and miserable shadows living in the mellow caves, whom he found pitiful. But he found it wasn’t enough, for the shadows would fight amongst themselves and harm one another. And so, he journeyed through meadows, dark forests, mountains, deep valleys and the dark corners of the abyss in search of the one thing that would help them. Until he read a book which led to a mysterious stone containing an amber of Light.

Gentle Light.

And so, the fragile being granted this Light upon the shadows and they learned compassion. They helped one another and they built a world for themselves. They have become humans. And thus, the fragile being laid rest, satisfied with his work. He then taught mankind Philosophy.

But the journey had exhausted the fragile being, and the old ones have come to retake Gentle Light from mankind. With his dying breath, the fragile being’s body turned into a river, seeding the world with his being. His heart remained, crystalized and turned into a tree, the Oaken Tree and thus the Oakenhearth.

The Oakenhearth remained at the center of the world, with its divine light protecting everything from the Abyss. More so, it carries with it the laws of the World, life, and death and everything between.

The Oaken Tree grows books with its branches, releasing fruits of books, carrying with it philosophies of different kind.

But the Oakenhearth has its own wisdom, for it recognizes those who possess mighty strength of will and great philosophy and grants them great power. These beings are called Emyreans, demi-god like beings.

It ushered an age of peace and prosperity as philosophy ruled in the hearts of men, reason stood above all. The Empyreans were led by Lyra the Radiant, and order was brought into the world. This ushered an age of prosperity and flourishing.

But the world was not without danger, for Yagranoth the Unsudering, the most powerful Empyrean and lover to Lyra lead his men to battle towards the border of the Mundane Lands where they fought beings of greater degeneracy, beings who embodies lust, greed, sin But Yagranoth’s divine Light was strong and  he could not be corrupted.

But as days passed, years passed, Yagranoth grew tired of fighting. He has changed over many decades of fighting and seeing his men die. He seeked a much more permanent solution to the invasion of the abysmal monsters. And so Yagranoth seeked the power of the Oakenhearth, to make it stronger and permanently seal off the abyss from the Mundane Lands, Yagranoth seeked the heretical witches of the Forlorn cave to have access to their wretched creation, a false heart, an immitation of the Oakenhearth, the [[Willowhearth]]. However, he found that, as the Oakenhearth gives light, the Willowhearth takes light. As he used that power, he learned that it takes the Gentle Light away from his men and thus they become “Faded”, transluscent beings who revives whenever they die.

With this, Yagranoth became convinced that he needed this power to protect the life of his men. He didn’t want anyone to die anymore. As he told this to his wife, Lyra, she became disgusted and told him that it is a curse and a cruel act to take the Light away from men. He tried convincing her but she never agreed and thus resulted in their parting ways.

The world is divided in five regions. The last region, the Twilight Zone is the only region protected by Light. Here, the people lived in ignorance of what had happened
