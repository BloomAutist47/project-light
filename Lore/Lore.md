# Beginning

Once there was no [[Light]], only darkness. During this time, there were only monsters and chaos gods who brought ruins upon the pitiful shadows.

It was during this time that the [[Eternity Well]], mysterious and powerful, spewed the Spark of [[Light]] which granted immense power upon those who picked it. Powerful [[Outer God]]s divided it among themselves and thus gained individuality. One of them, however, was meek and fragile. He did not find Light, but he found a flame that gives warmth. And with it, he gave heat to the cold and miserable shadows living in the mellow caves, whom he found pitiful. But he found it wasn’t enough, for the shadows would fight amongst themselves and harm one another. And so, he journeyed through meadows, dark forests, mountains, deep valleys and the dark corners of the abyss in search of the one thing that would help them. Until he read a book which led to a mysterious stone containing an amber of Light.

[[Gentle Light]].

And so, the fragile being granted this Light upon the shadows and they learned compassion. They helped one another and they built a world for themselves. They have become humans. And thus, the fragile being laid rest, satisfied with his work. He then taught mankind Philosophy.

But the journey had exhausted the fragile being, and the old ones have come to retake Gentle Light from mankind. With his dying breath, the fragile being’s body turned into a river, seeding the world with his being. His heart remained, crystalized and turned into a tree, the Oaken Tree and thus the Oakenhearth.

The Oakenhearth remained at the center of the world, with its divine light protecting everything from the Abyss. More so, it carries with it the laws of the World, life, and death and everything between.

# Age of Light

The Oaken Tree grows books with its branches, releasing fruits of books, carrying with it philosophies of different kind. But few were interested in them, only [[Titus the Oakenreader]] kept a library archiving everything that the tree release. For the tree did not release knowledge of war or of healing or of great magic, but merely books on how to live well.

But the Oakenhearth has its own wisdom, for it recognizes those who possess mighty strength of will and great philosophy and grants them great powers. These beings are called Emyreans, demi-god like beings.

It ushered an age of peace and prosperity as philosophy ruled in the hearts of men, reason stood above all. The Empyreans were led by Lyra the Radiant, and order was brought into the world. This ushered an age of prosperity and flourishing.

But the world was not without danger, for Yagranoth the Unsudering, the most powerful Empyrean and lover to Lyra lead his men to battle towards the border of the Mundane Lands where they fought beings of greater degeneracy, beings who embodies lust, greed, sin But Yagranoth’s divine Light was strong and  he could not be corrupted.

But as days passed, years passed, Yagranoth grew tired of fighting. He has changed over many decades of fighting and seeing his men die. He seeked a much more permanent solution to the invasion of the abysmal monsters. The Oakenhearth has grown weaker and monsters keep pouring through the light. And so Yagranoth seeked the power of the Oakenhearth, to make it stronger and permanently seal off the abyss from the Mundane Lands, Yagranoth seeked the heretical witches of the Forlorn cave to have access to their wretched creation, a false heart, an immitation of the Oakenhearth, the [[Willowhearth]]. However, he found that, as the Oakenhearth gives light, the Willowhearth takes light. As he used that power, he learned that it takes the Gentle Light away from his men and thus they become “Faded”, transluscent beings who revives whenever they die.

With this, Yagranoth became convinced that he needed this power to protect the life of his men. He didn’t want anyone to die anymore. As he told this to his wife, Lyra, she became disgusted and told him that it is a curse and a cruel act to take the Light away from men. He tried convincing her but she never agreed and thus resulted in their parting ways.

But Lyra wouls not agree, and neither the people who followed her. And so they waged war against Yagranoth to slay him as a Betrayer. But Yagranoth felt righteous indignance.  He criticized the remaining Empyreans for their weakness and choosing to live a safe life. As beings who fought for decades in the border of the Mundane Lands,  Yagranoth and his immortal army proved too powerful.

In the end, as he sieged the last of the Empyreans and their army, Lyra the Radiant, in a bid of desperation and pride, shattered the Oakenhearth, not allowing her husband to gain control of it. This ended up causing the very thing they were preventing the most, the invasion of the abyss and the [[Outer God]]s. 

This is known as the [[Night of the Splintering]] which ensued a chaotic war that led to the lost of many lives and the fall of Empyreans.

Nobody knew exactly what had occured as the laws of time, space, and life itself became murky. 

But as the dust of war faded, the pieces of the Oakenhearth was finally gathered together. But a final piece was missing and it could not be rebuilt.

# Age of Prosperity

The heroes of the time, the Five Kings of men, seeked help from the Witches of the Forlorn Cave, for only they knew about the Oakenhearth the most.

And so, the Witches cast their spells upon the pieces of the Oakenhearth and created domes of Stable Light throughout the world to keep the abyss at bay.

Nobody knew where the last piece of the Oakenhearth is.

Deep within Mount Kalingrad laid a single witch. Ancient and forlorn, she was called Yuryalis, daughter of Yagranoth and Lyra. She was the cause of the [[Night of the Splintering]], rhe schemer who taught the Witchea of the Forlorn Cave to craft the [[Willowhearth]]. She caused everyting, in her bid to break free from her fate and the inevitable doom of the [[Mundane Lands]] that she had foreseen. She carries the last piece of Oakenhearth.


Within the five domes of light, the five kingdoms prospered. Trade and commerce improved.

But there are lands whose Light did not shone through, and the withered arose. And so, the Kings sent their greatest Heroes to subdue these poweful withered beings. 

# Age of Waning

Years passed and the Heroes were greatly heralded by the Five Kingdoms.

The Five Kings granted them luxury andvmany great rewards in return to their service.

But the pieces of the Oakenhearth bevan waning, for they were weak without the others. Not wanting war, the Kings sent their Heroes in the Dark Lands in search of cure. And in this search, they found the [[Willowhearth]].

One of the heroes, Galleon the Heroic Blade found that giving Faded Light into the Willowhearth granted him the power to take the Light of others, and thus made hin stronger.

Blinded by his ambition to reunite all of the pieces of the Oakenhearth, Galleon linked the Willowhearth with the piece of an Oakenhearth from his homeland, and thus became the first [[Lord of Shade]]
