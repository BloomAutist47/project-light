# Creation
Laying in a forgotten, dark corner of the Eternal Abyss was a [[Fragile being]], one of the [[Outer God]]s who refuses to participate in the war for the [[Fragments of the Light]], one of the most primordial forces of existence which gave birth to conciousness. In his refusal to take side, the [[Outer God]] striked upon him, shattering his [[Greater Will]]. Bloody and broken, he landed fell in that tiny corner. But he was not alone, for there are many creatures living in the [[Eternal Abyss]] who've grown weary of the battles between the [[Outer God]]. As he laid in the ground, dying from his injuries, these creatures went and comforted him, bringing to him fruits and meat to soothe him. In his dying breathe, the [[Fragile being]] took out a tiny piece from the [[Fragments of the Light]] which he stole, and thus created the [[Mundane Lands]] to keep those who comforted him safe.

The death of the [[Fragile being]] caused a flood which seeded the earth into a world brimming with life. His heart melted forming the [[Golden Obsidian]] which embodies the laws and order of the [[Mundane Lands]].

# Ancient Era
The Mundane Lands grew prosperous. It had no kings but it had order, and the races between the Mundane lands were harmonious, thus ushering the [[Golden Age of Prosperity]], where ancestors of [[Man]], [[Mer]], [[Tyr]], and the [[Syt]].

The [[Golden Obsidian]] was hidden in [[Golden Castle of Light]] within [[Mt. Kalingrad]], guarded each by a powerful [[Empyrean]], a mortal whose strength, might, and righteous will is so powerful that the [[Golden Obsidian]] recognized them, thus granting them even greater power and hence demi-god status.

The [[Empyrean]]'s were led by Lyra the Radiant. In her mighty blade, all opposing dark forces fell.

## Outer Invasion
But the [[Outer God]] became aware of the existence of the [[Mundane Lands]] and thus raced to steal the [[Golden Obsidian]] which is said to contain a spark from the [[Fragments of the Light]]. However, their attempts at taking it proved futile as the protection left behind by the [[Fragile being]] was abnormally powerful.

Over time, many [[Outer God]] grew a sense of fascination towards the beings that lived within the [[Mundane Lands]] and some took a stance of being a god to them, in both benevolent and malicious ways.

The center religion within the [[Mundane Lands]] was the [[Worship of the Fragile]], as they worshiped their God-Ancestor, the [[Fragile being]].

Of the four races that populated the [[Mundane Lands]], men were the weakest. They wield neither great potential for magic nor were their strength great. But among all races, they excelled in surviving.
