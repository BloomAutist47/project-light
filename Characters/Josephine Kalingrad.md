Is a [[Faded One]] who lost her [[Gentle Light]].

She used to be a noble lady of a count's household. Living a carefree life of party and balls, Josephine never thought anything otherwise.

But her life changed when the Light which protected her countdom faded, plunging her territory in darkness. One by one, her servants fell to sickness starting from the children.

As her whole life flipped, Josephine's viewpoint also drastically changed, her innocense cruelly taken away and her world of bliss and ignorance faded.

Her father, the Count Kalingrad went to the capital city in search for help. But he never returned.

And so, Josephine cried as she saw her territory engulped by the absence of Light. Whereas before she held her servants and people with no regard, now the last of their food has gone. 

"When before she had Light, she could not see and thus lived in ignorance. And now her Light has been taken away, and her humanity returned."

Thus when only few remained of her people, she took the last of her soldiers in search of Light, based on a rumour they had no choice but to gamble on.
