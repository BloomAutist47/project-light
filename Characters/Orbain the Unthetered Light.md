Is a mighty and extremely powerful Sorcerer-Knight King who rules over the [[Kingdom of Arendor]].

Orbain learned to channel thetered light from monks living in [[Mt. Kalingrad]]. This was a healing light, used by the [[Monks of Kalingrad]] as a means of enlightenement. But Orbain saw the potential for battle and thus developed his own sword technique, the Unthetered Lightblade. 

With his new found power and his inheritance of an apple that granted him immense strength, Orbain returned back to his kingdom and usurped the throne from his elder brother whom he saw as a useless man, caring only for himself and not for the people. Thus Orbain became King.

In his free time, Orbain would herd chickens in his backyard. Because this is such a strange thing in contrast to his reputation as a Might Warrior King, he set up [[Unthetered Knights of Arendor]], knights whom he trained in the [[Unthetered Light]] to guard the perimeters and prevent anyone from approaching.

When he was young, Orbain was lonely as his mother was but a maid-servant and the other heirs does not look at him favourably. His uncle, brother of his mother, gifted him a chicken to befriend.

Orbain's loneliness was cured by his chicken companion, [[Astolfo]] who would always be with him and even defend him. 

Orbain wanted to be a chicken farmer and raise chickens, but as years passed, he saw the disgrace and perversion that his elder brother, who ascended at the throne, had done.

He remembered his Uncle's teachings. A simple man, and thus his teachings were simple, but it was exactly because of that that it was profound.

"You see Orbain, people like me, we're just weak. We can't protect ourselves. That's why we heralded a King, so that that King could protect us. I hope every king we have would protect us."

His uncle did not meant anything more, but Orbain interpreted this differently and realized that with him not doing anything, his uncle and his family would be brought to ruin.

And so Orbain set on a journey, seeked the [[Monks of Kalingrad]], learned the [[Unthetered Light]], battled the [[Dragon Osiris]], killed the Armies of Undead, and ascended the throne by forcefully taking it.

One day, his chicken [[Astolfo]] grew ill. His doctors, noted that it was reaching the end of its lifespan and soon will die. Unwilling to accept this, Orbain travelled to the east in search for the [[Sentinel Trees]] and learned their extremely difficult [[Life Magick]]. Succeeded, he returned and thus prolonged the life of [[Astolfo]], his most loyal companion.
