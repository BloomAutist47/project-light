Is a Loyal Knight of [[Lorean, Lord of Face]] unwithered by the absence of light. He used to be a beggar on the streets, but in an act of following a trend amongst noble ladies to pick a beggar and raise it as a knight, [[Lorean, Lord of Face]], took him and raised him as such.

Though he knew he was not picked out of kindness, Flabious still remained Loyal and for, as he quoted, "*Everything I own came from her, and so I will fight and protect her, even if she becomes a monster*"
