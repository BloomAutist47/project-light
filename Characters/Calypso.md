Calypso is an androgynous, gray haired, white skinned human, wearing a healer's robe. He manages the [[Tower of Gold]] and waits for would-be warriors who could fulfilk the [[Promised Light]].

He profess the [[Prophecy of the Faded One]], which tells the tale of a [[Faded One]] that will kill all [[Faded Lord]], gather all six [[Oakenhearth]], reconnect them, and deliver the [[Promised Light]]. In truth, this is nothing but nonsense that Calpyso created in order to motivate any Faded One tk venture in a death quest.

Calpyso is a tragic character born from the mistakes of the [[Chamberlain of One God]], a fanatic religion who reshapes the genitalia of infant boys into an elephant-like form, a practice to make it shape in the image of their God.

But the surgery was butchered and Calypso lost his genitalia all together. During this time, [[Mr. Funds]], a high ranking member of the [[Chamberlain of One God]] suggested to hus young parents tk raise him as a girl and in return, allowed [[Mr. Funds]] to cast gender re-assignment spells on Calypso, modifying his blood into a woman's blood.

As Calypso grew up, he thought he was a girl, but sometimes he would do things that onky boys would do. [[Mr. Funds]] watches over he boy as he grew up, but was very cruel and would hit, scream, and beat him.

His parents remained ignorant, and were fooled by illusion spells cast by [[Mr. Funds]]. The abuse would go on for years that Calypso chose to kill himself, however, [[Mr. Funds]] would prevent him.

It was until [[Galleon the Moonhealer]], who came to annihilate the [[Chamberlain of One God]], found Calypso, took him in as his disciple and raised him with Love.

Although [[Galleon the Moonhealer]] could not return Calypso's missing member, it was enough that he allowed the  boy to live a peaceful life.
