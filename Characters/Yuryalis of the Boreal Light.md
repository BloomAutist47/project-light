The Daughter of [[Lyra the Radiant]] and [[Yagranoth the Unsundering]].

She came to learn a flawed truth that, as the [[Oakenhearth]] gives them Light, it also stiffles their potential. That the truth, is that their path is already set in motion and thus nothing they do really matters.

Yuryalis refused to accept and thus, after communing with the [[God of Destined Strings]], she broke Destiny and set out on a quest to create her own path.
