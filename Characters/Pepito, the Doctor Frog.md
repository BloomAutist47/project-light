Is a giant bull frog who wore a doctor's hat and a monocle. He is old and beared and is a being seen favourably by others such that no one would want him harm.

Pepito is a very kind and gentle frog who would help others in need without asking any in return. He guides and willingly teaches others anything about the subject of medicine.

Many years ago, he found two infant babies from an ancient catacomb, frozen in time. Their bodies were draped with the clothe bearing the **Mark of an Empyrean**. With the babies came a letter containing knowledge of the past and instructions on how to raise the two girls. For reasons unknown, Pepito burned the paper and took the two babies and raised them as his daughters, teaching them about medicine and leading them to a simple life.

But things would change when [[Selenia, Master of Twilight|Selenia]] found the [[Twilight Fireflies]] and seeked to learn their magick. Similarly, [[Sunderia Morningstar|Sunderia]] would find the [[Deep Starcries]] and seeked to learn their blade.

He was also sometimes called **Peidouras of the Healing Philosphy.** But Pepito shuns such a name and prefers the more humble; [[Pepito, the Doctor Frog]].
