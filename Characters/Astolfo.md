Is the favourite chicken companion of [[Orbain the Unthetered Light]]. In his love for his chicken, Orbain learned [[Life Magick]] from the [[Sentinel Trees]], an extremely notorious magick that is said to be unlearnable by humans. 

But for his love for his chicken, [[Orbain the Unthetered Light]] still choose to learn it.

One day, Astolfo accidentally ate the [[Essence of Dragon Osiris]], much to [[Orbain the Unthetered Light|Orbain's]] dismay. He cast a spell in order to seal the essence inside the Chicken, thus not allowing it to wreck havoc.

---

When Josee defeats [[Orbain the Unthetered Light]]'s first phase, Astolfo will grew angry that he would forcibly unshakle the seal on the [[Essence of Dragon Osiris]] and thus become **Dragon Chicken Astolfo**.
