Is an extremely powerful Archknight and twin sister of [[Selenia, Master of Twilight]]. 

When she was but an infant, [[Pepito, the Doctor Frog]] found her in an ancient catacombs, but she would not learn of this until later in life.

In her Journey, she met the [[Deep Starcries]], an Order of Knights who uses a unique form of magick, the **Starry Water Magick** and combines it with their sword skills.

After they saved her, they recognized her talent and thus took her in as their disciple.

A decade later, Sunderia would defeat their leader and would be crowned **Morningstar**, the leader of their religious knightly order.
